Welcome to my first Jekyll blog post! This is much simpler than I thought.

## Why Jekyll?

Jekyll is great because:
- It's built into GitHub Pages
- Great SEO out of the box
- Simple to write posts in Markdown
- No JavaScript required for content

## Adding Images

You can add images easily:

## Code Snippets

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello from Jekyll!");
}
```

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

## Lists and More

Here's what you can do:
- Write in Markdown
- Add syntax highlighting
- Include images
- Create clean URLs automatically
- Get comments with Giscus

> This is a blockquote. Jekyll handles all the HTML generation for you!

That's it! Just push to GitHub and your blog is live with perfect SEO.
