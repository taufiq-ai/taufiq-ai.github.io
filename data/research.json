    "abstract": "Leukemia, a global health challenge characterized by malignant blood cell proliferation, demands innovative diagnostic techniques due to its increasing incidence. Among leukemia types, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) emerges as a particularly aggressive form affecting diverse age groups. This study proposes an advanced mechanized system utilizing Deep Neural Networks for detecting ALL blast cells in microscopic blood smear images. Achieving a remarkable accuracy of 97% using MobileNetV2, our system demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity in identifying multiple ALL sub-types.",
